Question Deep Dive :- 

I want to attempt to understand the question first, and then design the solution, then code it.

## **Requirements**

Please create two API endpoints for clients of the service:

1. **Captioning Endpoint**
    - A WebSocket accepting real-time audio packets and periodically returning captions.
    - The service should simulate caption content by returning sequential chunks of randomly generated 'lorem ipsum' text every X milliseconds. Define a reasonable delay that mimics the behavior of an actual transcription service.
2. **Usage Endpoint**
    - A RESTful resource returning the current captioning usage total for a given client.
    - Usage should be measured in **total milliseconds of captioning time based on received audio packets**. For example, if a client sends 50 packets (each representing 100ms), their usage total should reflect 5000ms.
3. **Tech Stack Preference**
    - We strongly prefer solutions that use **Node.js and Express**.


## My understanding :- 

1. **Captioning Endpoint**

WebSocket-based is required for an efficient 2 way communication.
This endpoint is designed to simulate a real-time transcription or captioning service.

Input: It accepts real-time audio packets from clients through a WebSocket connection.
Processing: Instead of actual transcription, it simulates captions by generating sequential chunks of 'lorem ipsum' text.
Output: These text chunks are sent back to the client periodically (e.g., every few hundred or thousand milliseconds) to mimic the latency of a real transcription service.
Delay Definition: We need to choose a reasonable interval (for example, every 500ms or 1000ms) to send out each chunk, simulating the delay one might expect in processing audio into captions.

2. **Usage Endpoint**

This endpoint is meant for tracking and reporting how much captioning service time each client has consumed.

How It Works:

Input: It receives a request (likely with a client identifier) to fetch usage data.
Calculation: The usage is computed by summing the total milliseconds of captioning time. For example, if each audio packet represents 100ms and a client sends 50 packets, the usage would be 5000ms.
Output: The endpoint returns the current usage total for the client in milliseconds.

3. **Tech Stack Preference**
Node.js is well-suited for handling asynchronous events. Express helps to make easy endpoints


## Overall Workflow and Considerations

1.Real-time Simulation:

The WebSocket server should handle concurrent connections, receive audio packets, and periodically send back simulated captions, maintaining a smooth flow similar to a live captioning service.

2. Usage Tracking:

Each incoming audio packet should contribute to a client's usage counter. Ensure that the server aggregates the timing information accurately, so the RESTful usage endpoint can report the correct total.

3. Integration of Both Endpoints:

While the WebSocket endpoint focuses on real-time interactions, the RESTful usage endpoint serves as a means to monitor and audit the service usage over time.

4. Scalability & Error Handling:
Given that the service involves real-time data and potentially many clients, proper error handling and scalability shnould be considered
